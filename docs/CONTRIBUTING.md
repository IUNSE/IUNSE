## Running Locally

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Ruby framework
for building static sites.

You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/),
[rubygems](http://rubygems.org/) and [bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed
before you can run the site locally.

If the above dependencies are installed, in your command line of preference,
navigate to the project repo and run:

```
~ $ gem install bundler jekyll
~ $ jekyll new awesomesite
~/cd awesomesite $

 bundle exec jekyll serve

# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```

Thanks!
